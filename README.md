# embedded-loop-station

This software is intended to be run on an embedded system. In particular, it
targets the hardware of the
[Teensy 4.1](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html) microcontroller. Once
installed onto the device, it allows the device to function as an audio loop
station: audio can be simultaneously recorded and played back continuously. A
variety of effects are available to be applied to recorded tracks.
